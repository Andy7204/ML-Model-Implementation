# ML Model Implementation
#### Data Visualisation file shows different types of graphs on which data can be shown.
### Three Models File
I have implemented three models with sample datasets.
1. Linear Regression - It plots two graphs one for training and one for test dataset.
2. Logistic Regression - It plots a confusion matrix representing its classification.
3. RandomForest Regression - It gives the lowest Mean Absolute Error with the best tree size.
### Decision Tree Model file 
Implements the Decision Tree model with best tree size.
### Linear Regression
It uses train_test_split to split data into test and training data and scatter plot to visualize the data.

### Logistic Regression
It uses feature scaling for data normalization and a confusion matrix to visualize the results.

### RandomForest Regressor
It finds out the lowest MAE by testing against a list of tree sizes and print the final MAE.
